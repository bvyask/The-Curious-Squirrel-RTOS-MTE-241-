README
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Questions:
-The code will be written in some IDE, any recommendations?
-When we do write the code, say in bloodshed, is the file in the folder
 going to be ourcode.cpp in our RTOS folder, and then we push and pull 
 this specific folder?
	It's our code .c not cpp if you pull you'll see bunch of files
	and you could edit that files but don't compile and just
	push and pull those files rather than folders
-Don't ask questions on README this is not what it should be used for

one more test
Updates:

Nov 6 - Header and C files created. - Bhavik
